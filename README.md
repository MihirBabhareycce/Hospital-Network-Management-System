# Hospital-Network-Management-System
In a hospital network system design created in Cisco Packet Tracer, the following components and configurations can be implemented:

Network Infrastructure: Use Cisco routers and switches to create a network backbone. Configure VLANs for different departments, ensuring secure and isolated communication.

Servers: Set up servers to host applications like the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, Clinical Information Systems, and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Assign appropriate IP addresses and configure necessary protocols.

End Devices: Include desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices for healthcare professionals to access the network. Configure IP addressing, implement security measures like antivirus software, and enable wireless connectivity for mobile devices.

Wireless Access Points: Deploy wireless access points throughout the hospital for seamless connectivity. Set up wireless security protocols like WPA2-PSK to ensure secure wireless communication.

Security Measures: Configure firewalls to protect the network from external threats. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor and block suspicious network activities. Use encryption protocols like SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.

Voice and Video Communication: Integrate Voice over IP (VoIP) phones and video conferencing equipment for real-time communication among healthcare professionals. Configure call manager and assign extensions for each phone.

Network Segmentation: Segment the network to isolate sensitive data and restrict access. Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control traffic flow and implement network policies.

Redundancy and Backup: Implement redundancy measures like redundant links, power backups, and redundant servers to ensure network availability. Set up regular data backups to prevent data loss.

Monitoring and Management: Utilize network monitoring tools to monitor network performance, detect issues, and troubleshoot problems. Implement network management protocols like SNMP for centralized monitoring and configuration.

Training and Documentation: Provide training to staff members on network usage, security protocols, and emergency procedures. Maintain comprehensive documentation of the network design, configurations, and policies for reference and future updates.

These are some of the key components and configurations that can be incorporated into a hospital network system design using Cisco Packet Tracer.
